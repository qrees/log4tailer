*********************************************
Basic functionality
*********************************************

Options:

Normal functionality:

log4tailer.py pathToLogs 

will tail the logs with colors. 

log4tailer.py -t "regex" pathToLogs

will tail the logs with colors and will emphasize the line that complies with the regex 

Throttling:

log4tailer.py --throttle secs pathToLogs

It will slow down the tailing if your application logs very fast

Silent Mode:

log4tailer.py -s fullpathToLogs

Silent Mode activates SMTP email action and alerts will be sent to 
the address specified. Log4Tailer will request for the SMTP options 
interactively.
Silent Mode basically daemonizes Log4Tailer monitoring the logs. In
case of a FATAL will send the log trace to the address specified.
You must provide the full path to the logs.

Color config parameters:

You can specify your own colors by providing the -c parameter

log4tailer -c config.txt pathToLogs

where config.txt, you can specify:

warn = yellow
info = green
debug = black
error = magenta
fatal = red

The above are the defaults and work well with a white or clear terminal background.

Other options, please refer to the wiki in the project webpage.

Enjoy
